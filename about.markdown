For the past 20 years Iâ€™ve served some of the most prominent financial institutions in Ireland and Europe, as an IT consultant on critical system migrations, virtualization and, more recently, AWS cloud computing projects

I am a diligent, open-minded individual who will strive, not only to get the job done, but to think of new ways to improve the bottom line going forward.
